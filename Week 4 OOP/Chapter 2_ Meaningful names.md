# OOP 
### interface vs abstract class
|subject|interface| abstract|
|---|---|---|
|Method|abstract method olny| method can have body|
|Inheritance| multiple implemention | single inheritance|
|Variables|final & static|like regluar classes|
|Access modifer|public|like regluar classes|

In summary, interfaces are great for defining contracts and enabling polymorphism across unrelated classes, while abstract classes are useful for sharing code and defining common behavior within a class hierarchy. Both are important tools in an object-oriented programmer's toolbox and are often used together to achieve various design goals.
