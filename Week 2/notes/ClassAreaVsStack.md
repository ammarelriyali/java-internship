# ClassArea Vs Stack
`Class Area`: When a class is loaded by the JVM, its bytecode, method definitions, and static data are stored in the class area. This includes the bytecode for all methods defined in the class.
`Stack`: When a method of the class is called (either a static method or an instance method), a new stack frame is created on the stack to hold the method's parameters and local variables. This stack frame is popped off the stack when the method completes execution.
